# Swag Labs Website - Manual Testing Project

This project documents my manual testing efforts on the Swag Labs e-commerce website. The goal of this project was to verify the quality of the website and to identify and document issues or bugs that could impact the user experience. I used manual testing techniques to design test cases, execute the tests, and document all results in an issue thread.

The scope of testing covered essential functionalities, including user login, product browsing, shopping cart management, and checkout processes. The testing did not include aspects such as performance, security, and cross-browser compatibility.

During the testing process, I created and executed 80 test cases. Among these test cases, 72 cases passed successfully, and 8 cases failed. I identified a total of 5 issues of varying priority and severity that require attention.

Some of the key issues discovered include:
    *  The ""Add to cart"" button changes to ""Remove"" and does not increase quantity but removes item from cart. (High Priority, Medium Severity)
    *   Sort dropdown does not open when clicking the arrow. (Medium Priority, Medium Severity)
    *   Unable to specify quantity before adding to the cart. (Medium Priority, Low Severity)
   *   Unable to enter characters in the sort field. (Medium Priority, Medium Severity)
   *  No ""Remove All"" option to remove all products from cart at once. (Low Priority, Low Severity)


Based on my findings, I recommended the following:
    * Address the issues with medium and high priority as these significantly affect the user experience.
    * Improve the user interface to be more intuitive.
    * Provide a ""Remove All"" option in the product page
    * Allow specifying the quantity before adding items to the cart.


This project allowed me to experience the process of manual testing and to improve my skills in designing test cases and documenting issues.
